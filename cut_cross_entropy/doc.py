LINEAR_CROSS_ENTROPY_DOC = """Computes cross-entropy loss using the logits generated by performing
    the matrix multiplication between the embeddings (e) and classifier (c).

    This method saves GPU memory by not materializing the logits into GPU
    main memory.


    Specifically, this computes

    ```python

    loss = F.cross_entropy((e @ c.T).float(), targets)
    ```

    without allocating the intermediary (e @ c.T).float() matrix.

    :param e: Embedding of the inputs used to compute the logits. Shape (..., D)
    :param c: Classifier matrix. Shape (NumClasses, D)
    :param targets: The target class for each input. Values must be in [0, NumClasses). Shape (...)
    :param ignore_index: If an input as a target of this value, it is ignored in the loss computation.
    :param softcap: The value for logit softcapping.
    :param reduction: The reduction to perform over the loss. Supports "mean", "sum", and "none".
    :param shift: When non-zero, the embedding and targets will be shifted along the temporal axis to perform nth-next token prediction.
        Specifically, this is used to efficiently compute the following

        ```python
        shift_e = e[..., :-shift, :].flatten(0, -2)
        shift_targets = targets[..., shift:].flatten()

        loss = F.cross_entropy((shift_e @ c.T).float(), targets)
        ```

        If given a boolean value, False will be treated as zero and True will be treated as one.

        When this value is non-zero or True, e and targets must have shape (..., T, D) and (..., T), respectively.

        Integer values must be in [0, T)
